              <h2>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned<br> were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I<br> honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h2>
              <P>“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a <br>
                transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up <br>
                for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
                The next 12<br> weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
                the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</P>

              <h2> Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h2>
              <p>    “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve<br> never written a line of code. I needed <br>some structure from 
                professionals<br> who can help me learn programming <br>step by step. I was encouraged to<br> enroll by a former 
                student of theirs<br> who can only say wonderful things <br>about the program. The entire<br> curriculum and staff 
                did not<br> disappoint. They were very hands-on<br> and I never had to wait long for <br>assistance. The agile team 
                project, in particular, was outstanding. It took<br> my learning to the next level in a way <br>that no tutorial 
                could ever have. In<br> fact, I’ve often referred to it during<br> interviews as an example of my developent 
                experience. It certainly<br> helped me land a job as a full-stack<br> developer after receiving multiple<br> offers. 
                100% recommend! ”

              <h2>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
                learning from their experiences was easy.</h2>
                <p>“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program 
                  gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present <br>myself as a capable 
                  junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the<br> personal attention you need from
